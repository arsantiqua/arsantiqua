drivers for arsantiqua music system
Listed here are the drivers necessary for the ArsAntiqua project.
The ArsAntiqua project is 'Yet another' system for creating an audiophile solution.
It consists of a hardware component coupled with a controller that is readily available.
The hope is to create an audiophile that doesn't mandate a mechanic to accompany the user.
The current control target is the Raspberry Pi, recommended by its availability and low cost.
